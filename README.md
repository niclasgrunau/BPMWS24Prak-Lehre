# BPMWS24Prakt

This project introduces a comprehensive web application built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, tailored for customizable label printing with seamless integration of a DYMO PNP LabelManager. The primary objective is to provide users with a robust platform where they can effortlessly create, customize, and print labels according to their specific requirements.

The application architecture is divided into two main components: a Node.js backend serving as the server-side logic and API endpoints, and a React frontend offering an intuitive user interface for label customization and management. Additionally, a local server component facilitates the direct connection to a DYMO PNP LabelManager device for printing commands.

You have 2 options to run this application. If you have access to run the backend of this application on [the lehre.bpm server](https://github.com/your-username/dymo-pnp), you can jump here: "die beiden urspr.". If not, you have to run it locally: "die dmyo-pnp-api"
